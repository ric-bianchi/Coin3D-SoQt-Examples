# To build everything in one go

Copy the whole present folder in another folder, so it is encapsulated. 

Then, copy the relevant script from the `scripts` folder to one folder below this, i.e. in the 'encapsulating', main folder:

```
cp scripts/INSTALL_ALL_LXPLUS.sh ../
```

Then go to the main folder and run the script:

```
source INSTALL_ALL_LXPLUS.sh
```
